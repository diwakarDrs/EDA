## What is EDA?

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. 

- It is good practice to understand the data first and try to gather as many insights from it. 
## Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.7  
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.

## Data Wrangling
After Observing the dataset and the questions related to this dataset for the analysis we will be keeping only relevent data and deleting the unused data.

- We need to remove duplicate rows from the dataset
- Changing format of release date into datetime format
- Remove the unused colums that are not needed in the analysis process.
- Remove the movies which are having zero value of budget and revenue.
